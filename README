Fitness Tracker is a sample app written using the .NET MVC framework.

This is my original app written using Visual Studio 2008.  However, I've continued working on this 
project using Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 -- see the most recently forked branch for the latest source.

I have also added my local database (SQL Server Express 2008) to this branch; see App_Data/FitnessTracker.mdf
for the application database.  The ASP.NET database must be created separately, but this should happen 
automatically.  However, the 'admin' role must be created separately, and any user that wished to
edit ExerciseType data must be a member of the 'admin' role.
