Fitness Tracker is a sample app written using the .NET MVC framework.

This is my latest branch of this app, converted from Visual Studio 2008 to VS2010.

There is no local database added, but I will try to add scripts for creating the database in the near future.
Database scripts will use SQL Server 2008 Express as a default, but will hopefully be easily tweaked for
upgraded versions.

The ASP.NET database still has be created separately, but this should happen automatically.  However, 
the 'admin' role must be created separately, and any user that wished to edit ExerciseType data must be 
a member of the 'admin' role.
